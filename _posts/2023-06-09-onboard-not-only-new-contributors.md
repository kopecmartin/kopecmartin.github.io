This topic is gonna be presented during OpenInfra Summit in Vancouver, June 13-15, 2023.

Most of the content will be added here after the Summit. If you're here now, it means you scanned the QR code at the end of the presentation. For now, this page provides additional content which we weren't able to squeze into our presentation.

## Summary
1. There is less contributors around than we were used to.
2. 3 most common obstacles preventing people from contributing to upstream:
    1. "no time"
    2. not knowing where to start
    3. not knowing where to find a suitable task.
3. 71% of people who don't contribute upstream regularly would appreciate a pool of 'first issue' tasks
4. Decrase the friction for contributors - make it easy and visible by creating a pool of tasks of lower difficulty (good for first time contributors)
5. Rules the pool of tasks (maybe not only easier ones) should follow these rules to gain the most out of it:
    1. Well documented - any relevant content (steps to reproduce, etc) so that anyone who takes a look at the task understands what is going on there - even someone who hasn't worked with that project before.
    2. Definition of Done - a set of conditions if met the work is considered done.
    3. Mentor (e.g. a core member) - someone with good knowledge about the project has to be notified on any questions, patches to review etc
    4. Quick response time from both - mentor and assignee (one of the obstacles is 'no time')
6. In upstream we already use low-hanging-fruit tag on Launchpad - let's build on top of that by making sure all tasks marked as such follow the 4 rules mentioned above.
